This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (React) Template for Signum Decentralized Applications (DApp).
It comes with a prebuilt architecture using:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/)
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- [SignumJS](https://signum-network.gitbook.io/signumjs/)

All the communication with the [XT wallet](https://github.com/signum-network/signum-xt-wallet)  is already implemented, such that the dev can focus on his DApp.

See how it's being used in the [Home Page](./features/home/index.tsx)
